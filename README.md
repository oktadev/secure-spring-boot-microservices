# Spring Boot Microservices Secured with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect

This repository contains a set of microservices that are secured with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. This is a sample project for the workshop ["Securing Spring Boot Microservices"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/workshops/spring-boot) from Auth0 by Okta.

The microservices are built using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. The OAuth2 provider is implemented using Auth0. The microservices are:

- **car-service**: A service that provides information about cars.
- **gateway**: A service that acts as a gateway to the other services.
- **discovery-service**: A service that provides service discovery.

Follow the [workshop](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/workshops/spring-boot) if you want to try this out.
